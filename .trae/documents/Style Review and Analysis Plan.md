I have completed the comprehensive review and analysis of the HTML and CSS code as requested. I have gathered sufficient information to generate the detailed report.

**Plan:**
1.  **Generate Report**: Create a markdown file named `style_review_report.md` in `c:\Users\Yang\Documents\Github\Wire-Bundle-Diameter-Calculation\.trae\report` (I will create the directory first).
2.  **Report Content**:
    *   **Overview**: Summary of the styling architecture (Monolithic CSS, JS-injected HTML).
    *   **Component Classification**: Grouping styles into Tables, Buttons, Inputs, Layouts, etc.
    *   **Code Review Findings**:
        *   **HTML**: Analysis of class naming (BEM-ish vs Utility), structural consistency.
        *   **CSS**: Identification of duplicate styles (especially in tables), global scope issues, and color/spacing inconsistencies.
        *   **JS Integration**: Highlighting inline styles used in JS (e.g., Modals, Convergence Panel) and hardcoded values.
    *   **Optimization Recommendations**:
        *   Refactoring tables into a single CSS component.
        *   Standardizing button variants.
        *   Moving inline JS styles to CSS classes.
        *   Implementing CSS variables for theming.
3.  **Final Output**: Present the path to the generated report to the user.

I am ready to proceed with writing the report.
